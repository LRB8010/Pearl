Thank you for taking the time to check out my project!!
I started my coding journey because I wanted to make a difference in the world. I wanted to give some good to this at times bad world. My dream is to one day be
good enough to teach kids from low-income families, to show them how fun and rewarding coding can be. Well, we all have to start somewhere, so I started here.
A few weeks before I decided to start on Pearl, I was watching some youtube videos of scam centers all over the world. These people would set up fake
websites and create fake viruses that would prompt users to call their "tech support" number in order to help them get rid of the virus. A lot of the targeted
people were senior citizens. They would tell them that they needed control of their machine in order to fix the problem. Then they would go through their personal
files and get whatever information they could. One of these victims had their whole retirement money stolen! This really ticked me off and made me want to help.
Help senior citizens with anything! So then came the idea. A website that would be specifically to help senior citizens! I know this is really not a solution for 
what I was mad about, but I would at least help with something. Pearl is a website where senior citizens can sign up and create tasks that they need help with.
These tasks can be anything! A ride to the doctor, a game of chess, a walk in the park, anything. Then people with spare time and a willingness to help can sign 
up as volunteers to help them accomplish them!
